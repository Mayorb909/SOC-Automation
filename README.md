# SIEM TOOLS DEPLOYMENT FOR THREAT AND ACTIVE RESPONSE

### OBJECTIVE
In an attempt to gain a deeper understanding of how Endpoint devices on an organization's network are effectively secured (as part of my SOC analyst training), I took on the challenge of learning how to use SIEM tools like Wazuh and Splunk with Sysmon to visualize all security events on endpoint devicesâ€”making it flexible to detect threats, vulnerabilities and compliance related issue. 

### SKILLS LEARNED
* I master how to deploy and configure Wazuh-Manager for various security alerts of my interest(depending on the organization's needs)
* I have mastered how to configure the Ossec-agent file for various security event monitoring.
* I mastered how to configure the firewall for traffic on any port
* I master how to read the event log on Wazuh and find out IOC(INDICATOR OF COOPROMISE)
* I have mastered how to configure the index rule for events of interest.

### STEPS
* I set up my network topology simulating a real-world organization's network infrastructure(for a small business) that uses a router, switch, firewall, and servers.
* I deploy Wazuh-server on an Ubuntu machine with a network interface ------
